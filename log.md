**Today's Progress**: <VnBargain App> add login and register layout, fixed CSS

**Thoughts:** I haven't code for a while, so it is great to be back on track. Hope that I will stick on this challenge to the end.

**Tommorow's Plan:** Continue working on VnBargain App. Also there are several challenges on Hackerank to solve.

### Day 1: March 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: <VnBargain App> add views for list and added deals to app. Added modules to support the use of mongodb in VnBargain App.

**Thoughts:** There are no conventional method to intergrate mongodb into express, so I have a little trouble with setting up the database and add code to connect to database. For now the system seem to run fine, however, there are more work that needed to be done to make sure the system run fine.

**Tommorow's Plan:** Continue working on VnBargain App. Also there are several challenges on Hackerank to solve.
