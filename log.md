**Today's Progress**: <VnBargain App> add login and register layout, fixed CSS

**Thoughts:** I haven't code for a while, so it is great to be back on track. Hope that I will stick on this challenge to the end.

**Tommorow's Plan:** Continue working on VnBargain App. Also there are several challenges on Hackerank to solve.
